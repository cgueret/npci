Runs the incomplete overlap example from Hill 2011, JCGS. Results end up in the "data" folder.

If you have access to a cluster which uses TORQUE, running the following from the command line will split the iterations up, generate, and submit jobs for the simulation:
  R --no-save < queueJobs.R

If you only have a local machine,
  R --no-save < runLocally.R

Edit either of those to change the simulations parameters. Otherwise, the simulation itself is in runJob.R.

Finally, results.R can be useful in mashing together the results and data.R creates an "x" and "z" for the simulation setting.
